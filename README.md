# SeattleAirbnb
## Analysis of Seattle Airbnb database from Udacity data science non-degree program

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:
Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

The following libraries were used for the analysis and visualization: 
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data to better understand:

How the trends in listings and hosts has changed over time?
Which parameters contribute most in receiving reviews for listings?
Which month is considered high season in Seattle? How prices fluctuates over a year? 


The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here. However, you can see pieces of the analysis [here] (https://medium.com/@nazanin.shaebani/travel-to-or-host-a-place-in-seattle-things-to-know-d84328328139). 


Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
